# BannerCreator

Procedural banner generator made using Processing 4!

## Why are there no releases!!11!1

Sadly when I exported the application for Windows and Linux neither of them worked so no releases for you! ;)

## So what do all the controls mean?

|Name|Action|
|-|-|
|Random|Hmm I wonder what this does...|
|Hue|The overall color of the image|
|Sat|The vibrance of the image|
|Shift|How much the hue changes from top to bottom|
|Depth|The darkness of the background|
|Gradient|How much the brightness changes across the image|
|Zoom|The size of the lines|
